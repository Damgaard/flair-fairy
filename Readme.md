# Reddit Flair Fairy

## What is the Flair Fairy?

The Flair Fairy is a reddit bot I made for [/r/badcode](http://www.reddit.com/r/badcode) that adds flair
to user's posts listing what language their posted code snippet uses.

## What license is it released under?

It is released under the [Unlicense](http://www.unlicense.org). In other words
do what you like, doesn't matter to me.

## Can I help?

Super yes, if you want to add more features to it, fork and send a pull request.
I'd be very appreciative.

## Installation

To install either [download the source](https://github.com/brownhead/flair-fairy/zipball/master)
and extract it or clone the repository using git.

`git clone git://github.com/brownhead/flair-fairy.git`

### Dependencies and requirements

Flair-fairy works with python 2.6 and 2.7. It *may* work with python 3.0+,
but testing for that is currently not a part of the development process.

Flairfairy has two dependencies. [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) and
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html). Install it
either using pip.

`pip install requests praw`

or easy_install

`easy_install requests praw`
