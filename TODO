I'd like to add the following features:
	+ Implement real logging with the python logging framework so it will
	  be easier to have the server send logging messages to other places.
	  (I would really like to be alerted by email when the bot goes down).
	+ Check to see if name_map.json has been updated periodically and
	  auto-magically reload it. (This feature might not be worth the
	  trouble).

And a related thing:
	+ I'd like for the flair on /r/badcode to look a little nicer. Add some
	  CSS style and some images and whatnot. At the moment it's pretty
	  ugly.
