I'd like to add the following features:
	+ Save the state of the bot when closing so it can resume immediately the next run.
	+ Check to see if name_map.json has been updated periodically and
	  auto-magically reload it. (This feature might not be worth the
	  trouble).

And a related thing:
	+ I'd like for the flair on /r/badcode to look a little nicer. Add some
	  CSS style and some images and whatnot. At the moment it's pretty
	  ugly.
